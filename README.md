# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock!
After seeing the `hand` icons in FontAwesome, the game had to follow. Thanks [Dave Gandy](https://twitter.com/davegandy)!

To use the game, simply open in your browser of choice :) The ultimate game of wits and skill..

The user's choice can be selected either by clicking on the icon or by using the left/right keyboard buttons.

The 'AI' is left up to the randomness of the `Math.random` JavaScript function. Plenty of actual machine learning projects have been done that put the odds well and truly in the computers favour, but where's the fun in that?
 
The carousel and tts engines have been cached in the project to simplify referencing

**N.B. The carousel engine has also been modified to allow for enabling/disabling of rotation in a way that better
suits the game**

# Acknowledgements

The RPSLS game uses the following open source software:

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for all the JS awesomeness.
- [Cloud 9 Carousel](https://github.com/specious/cloud9carousel) for rotating through the users selection.
- [ResponsiveVoice.JS](http://responsivevoice.org/) for TTS.
- [FontAwesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome) for icon-y goodness.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive layout.

Thanks must of course also go to [Sam Kass](http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html). Great addition to the original!
