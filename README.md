# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock!
After seeing the `hand` icons in FontAwesome, the game had to follow. Thanks [Dave Gandy](https://twitter.com/davegandy)!

To use the game, simply open in your browser of choice :)
 
The carousel and tts engines have been cached in the project to simplify referencing

**N.B. The carousel engine has also been modified to allow for enabling/disabling of rotation in a way that better
suits the game**

# Acknowledgements

- [ResponsiveVoice.JS](http://responsivevoice.org/) for TTS.
- [FontAwesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome) for icon-y goodness.
